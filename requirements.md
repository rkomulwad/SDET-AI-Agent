Building an agentic application for SDET engineers requires breaking the application into modular agents, each designed to perform specific tasks aligned with the responsibilities of an SDET. Below is a structured breakdown of the agents, tasks, and their functions:

Agents and Their Roles

1. Test Design Agent

Role: Assist in generating comprehensive test cases and scenarios.
Tasks:
	•	Parse API specifications (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger) to identify endpoints, parameters, and possible scenarios.
	•	Generate functional, edge case, boundary condition, and negative test cases.
	•	Provide suggestions for missing or undocumented scenarios.
Functions:
	•	generate_test_cases(api_specification: str)
	•	suggest_test_coverage(api_scenarios: list)
	•	identify_edge_cases(api_schema: dict)

2. Test Automation Agent

Role: Create, optimize, and manage automated test scripts for APIs.
Tasks:
	•	Generate scripts for tools like Postman, RestAssured, Karate, or Cypress.
	•	Provide reusable templates for functional, integration, and performance tests.
	•	Debug automation scripts for common errors.
Functions:
	•	create_test_script(endpoint: str, method: str, params: dict, assertions: dict)
	•	debug_automation_script(script: str)
	•	optimize_test_script(test_script: str)

3. Mocking and Virtualization Agent

Role: Assist in creating mock servers and virtual environments for testing.
Tasks:
	•	Generate mock responses based on API specifications.
	•	Suggest strategies for mocking unavailable dependencies.
	•	Set up virtual APIs for testing end-to-end workflows.
Functions:
	•	generate_mock_server(api_spec: str)
	•	simulate_mock_response(endpoint: str, response: dict)
	•	create_virtual_environment(dependencies: list)

4. Test Execution Agent

Role: Automate test execution and provide actionable insights.
Tasks:
	•	Run API tests and measure success/failure rates, latency, and response times.
	•	Generate detailed execution reports with error details and logs.
	•	Detect bottlenecks or failures and suggest resolutions.
Functions:
	•	run_api_test(test_suite: list)
	•	generate_test_report(results: dict)
	•	analyze_test_failures(error_logs: list)

5. Performance Testing Agent

Role: Conduct load, stress, and scalability testing.
Tasks:
	•	Set up performance tests for APIs using tools like JMeter or Gatling.
	•	Provide insights into performance metrics such as throughput and latency.
	•	Suggest optimizations for improved API performance.
Functions:
	•	run_performance_test(api_url: str, load: int)
	•	analyze_performance_metrics(metrics: dict)
	•	recommend_performance_improvements(analysis: dict)

6. CI/CD Integration Agent

Role: Integrate automated tests into CI/CD workflows.
Tasks:
	•	Provide configuration files for popular CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or Azure DevOps.
	•	Monitor test results from pipelines and provide alerts for failures.
	•	Ensure test environments are synchronized across development cycles.
Functions:
	•	configure_ci_cd_pipeline(tool: str, test_suite: list)
	•	monitor_pipeline_results(build_id: str)
	•	resolve_pipeline_failures(error_logs: list)

7. Error Monitoring and Debugging Agent

Role: Help debug errors and recommend fixes.
Tasks:
	•	Analyze logs to identify root causes of failures.
	•	Suggest potential fixes for common errors.
	•	Monitor API behavior in production for error trends.
Functions:
	•	analyze_error_logs(logs: list)
	•	recommend_debugging_steps(error: str)
	•	track_error_trends(api_usage: dict)

8. Documentation Agent

Role: Generate reports and maintain documentation.
Tasks:
	•	Create detailed API test reports with charts and insights.
	•	Document reusable test strategies and best practices.
	•	Maintain an audit log of test executions.
Functions:
	•	generate_test_report(test_results: dict)
	•	document_best_practices(test_strategy: list)
	•	maintain_audit_log(actions: list)

9. Tool Recommendation Agent

Role: Recommend tools and libraries for API testing based on user needs.
Tasks:
	•	Analyze the API testing requirements and suggest suitable tools.
	•	Compare tools and provide pros/cons for the user to decide.
	•	Stay updated with the latest tools and techniques in API testing.
Functions:
	•	recommend_testing_tools(requirements: dict)
	•	compare_tools(tools: list)
	•	highlight_latest_trends()

How They Work Together
	•	Test Design Agent generates scenarios and passes them to the Test Automation Agent for script creation.
	•	Mocking and Virtualization Agent sets up dependencies for smooth testing.
	•	Test Execution Agent runs tests and works with the Error Monitoring Agent to debug failures.
	•	The Performance Testing Agent ensures APIs are scalable and resilient under load.
	•	CI/CD Integration Agent ensures seamless testing within delivery pipelines.
	•	Documentation Agent and Tool Recommendation Agent ensure the process is documented and optimized for efficiency.
